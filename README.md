# Email-Queue-Simulator
This Java program simulates the queuing, dequeuing, and processing of emails in a timed environment. The program uses a queue to receive and send out emails while tracking statistics such as the number of emails received, dequeued, and requeued. The simulation runs for 15 minutes in real-time, processing emails every second.
